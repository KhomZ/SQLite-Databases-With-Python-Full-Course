# SQLite-Databases-With-Python-Full-Course
## @Khom
In this course we'll learn the basics of using SQLite3 with Python. SQLite is an easy-to-use database engine included with Python.

We'll learn how to create databases and tables, add data, sort data, create reports, pull specific data, and more. 
For this course you should already have a basic knowledge of Python programming, but don't you worry, to know all about databases or SQLite, you don't need to know anything at all.
